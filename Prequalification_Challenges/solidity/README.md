## Dan's storage is not private - Solidity challenge

The story goes like... your friend Dan from crypto Telegram requested you to audit this small smart contract. You need to prove that it is easy to steal the flag and show "private" is not private.

Figure out the flag by using the Solidity smart contract provided. The goal is to correctly follow the assemble logic of the concat in is_it_on_chain().
