## search&ink! challenge

This challenge has four requirements to pass:

1. Map the services behind 45.77.137.182 and a way to connect (Alice helps!)
2. Find the flag on-chain! Format as in other challenges PMC{...}
3. Deploy the flipper ink! smart contract from your player DOT address (the one you use in the prequalifer registration form) on 45.77.137.182
4. Automate the coin clip function call and share the code through the registration form.

This challenge requires you to have a basic understanding of Substrate and ink! smart contracts.

Please make sure to upload your solution through the form when you submit it - a text file is enough with a short explanation.
