With the birth of the metaverses digital identities are will be an integral building block of Web3.

DIDs are the decentralized identifiers for the future of Web3, and this challenge is to make them usable for the metaverse.

## Task
- Integrate KILT DIDs into a metaverse project as an identity layer (e.g. Kusamaverse).
- Add authentication to the metaverse
- Be creative!
- BONUS: make a PR into the metaverse project's repo
