# Judge&Mentor Challenge for Polkadot Metaverse Championship

## Description
Fun challenge for the judges and mentors. Totally optional, but it is cool to show-off your skills! Show everyone why you are in the position! :)

## Task
1. Play an arcade or VR game with other judges/mentors.
2. Record the experience on blockchain (anything works, be creative, try to make it fun)

Tip: you could use some strange languages, encoding or fun, unusual practices to solve this. Eg. Bitcoin's smart contract or this:
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++

It doesn't apply here :) You have the whole location, show us something cool!
